## Planning and Development:

The planning phase consisted of various elements which were modified as necessary while the project continued to evolve.

It all started with a wireframe and some user stories about what the TPSY web application should do. **At its heart it's an app to keep track of beers someone has tried with a section to write a description and some notes of the beer**.

The back-end and front-end were set up with a somewhat barebones approach so that both elements existed in some form at the project's beginning. This was to better envision to project's development.

Most of the **back-end work was done earlier on**, focusing on creating models, routes and linking npm packages, middleware and other necessary components.

**The focus then shifted towards expanding on the front end** and linking together the front and back ends for seamless use.

With a working (albeit not visually pleasing) front end, development continued in the design/layout realm. The age to legally purchase and consume alcohol in the US is 21+ so it was decided **the web application should sport a 'mature' and 'modern' color scheme and layout theme**.

While the present version of TPSY focuses on beer, it was **intentionally designed as a flexible/open-ended web app**, able to introduce other beverages and expanded features/capabilities which may make an appearance in future versions.

### Possible features for future versions:

- Expanded resources (wines, mixed drinks, etc).
- A 'favorites' system, or some other kind of rating system.
- Connecting users somehow.
- Adding comments from one user to a different user's beer cards.
- Integration of other, developed API's to expand the feature base.
